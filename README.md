# Critical Endpoint Alert via CUCM

Critical Alert on Endpoint Issue


## Business/Technical Challenge

Many customers have Cisco Unified Communications Manager *CUCM* phones and video systems in critical areas like hospital rooms, CXO desks and Continuity Of OPerations *COOP* sites.  These Customers need to know the moment there are issues with CUCM endpoints.  Customers want their support teams to **respond proactively** and **reduce the mean time to repair.**

It is no longer acceptable to wait to take action until after a user reports an issue.  In many situations, critical endpoints demand 99.999% uptime.  In order to maintain this high level of service, Information Technology Teams need to **leverage the power of programmability and automation** to proactively respond to issues with critical phones and video systems. 

Customers will rest easy when they utilize our **Critical Endpoint Alert via *CUCM*** system.    In fact, they may have to change their name from the response team to the advanced response team ;-) 

## Proposed Solution

Our project uses programmability and automation to monitor a Customer's critical phones and video systems.  When a issue with a critical endpoint is detected, a *ServiceNow* ticket will be opened automatically with the highest priority.  The response team will be alerted via a message sent from *ServiceNow* to a *Webex Teams* space. 

The application programming interfaces of  *CUCM* - *ServiceNow* - *Webex Teams* were utilized to create this automated process.
